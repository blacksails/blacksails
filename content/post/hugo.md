OK, i finally got my domain name [blacksails.io](http://blacksails.io). So i
thought that i'd better start writing. First things first I need a place to
start writing stuff. I heard that static site generators are what the cool kids
does. Actually I experimented with Jekyll some time ago, but I never really got
that much into it. Since then I have been writing a lot of go so I thought why
not try a static site generator written in go -- hugo.
